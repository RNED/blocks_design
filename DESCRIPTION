Description: Nested block designs for unstructured treatment sets with simple blocks or
     nested row-and-column blocks. Treatments can have any arbitrary
    replication and blocks can be nested to any required feasible depth of nesting.
    Blocks are optimized hierarchically from the top down with each
    set of nested blocks optimized within the levels of any higher-level
    blocks. Block sizes are equal if the number of blocks exactly divides the number
    of plots, otherwise they differ by at most one plot. The design output is a
    data table giving a randomised allocation of treatments to blocks together with
    plans showing the allocation of treatments to blocks in the bottom stratum of the design. 
    Achieved D and A-efficiency factors are shown for each blocks stratum together with an A-efficiency
    upper bound where available.
