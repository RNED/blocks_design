Description: Constructs randomized nested and crossed block designs for
    factorial or unstructured treatment sets where treatments can have any arbitrary
    feasible depth of nesting. Factorial treatment models are defined by using the
    model formulation given in the model.matrix {stats} base package. Blocks can be
    nested to any required depth of nesting and blocks are optimized hierarchically
    from the top down with successive nested blocks strata optimized within the
    levels of all preceding blocks strata. Block sizes are all equal in any one
    stratum if the number of blocks in that stratum exactly divides the number of
    plots, otherwise they differ by at most one plot. The design outputs include a
    data frame showing the allocation of treatments to blocks with successive nested
    strata arranged in standard block order and a table showing the block levels and
    the achieved D- and A-efficiency factors for each blocks stratum together with
    A-efficiency upper bounds, where available. For simple unstructured treatment
    designs, a plan showing the allocation of treatments to blocks or to rows and to
    columns in the bottom stratum of the design is also output.
