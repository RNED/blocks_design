Description: Block designs for unstructured treatment sets with simple nested block designs
    or nested and crossed row-and-column designs. Treatments can have any arbitrary level of
    replication and blocks can be nested to any required depth of nesting.
    Blocks are optimized hierarchically from the top down with each new set of 
    nested blocks optimized within each level of the existing
    blocks. Block sizes are equal if the number of blocks exactly divides the number
    of plots, otherwise they differ by at most one plot. The design output is a
    data table showing a randomised allocation of treatments to blocks together with
    plans showing the allocation of treatments to blocks for each block in the bottom stratum of the design. 
    D and A-efficiency factors are shown for each stratum together with an A-efficiency
    upper bound, where available.
