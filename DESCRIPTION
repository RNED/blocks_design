Description: Constructs randomized nested or crossed block designs for 
    unstructured treatment sets or for factorial treatments sets. Where the 
    treatments are factorial, the treatments model can be defined by using the
    model formulation defined in the model.matrix {stats} base package. Blocks
    are nested hierarchically in succesively nested blocks strata and the blocks
    model in any particular stratum comprises either a simple nested blocks 
    design or a crossed row-and-column design. Block sizes in any one stratum 
    are either all equal or differ, at most, by one plot. The design outputs 
    include a data frame showing the allocation of treatments to blocks and a table
    showing the block levels, the achieved D- and the A-efficiency factors for
    the design together with A-efficiency upper bounds, where available, for each 
    stratum in the blocks design. For designs with simple unstructured treatments,
    a plan layout showing the allocation of treatments to blocks or to rows and
    columns in the bottom stratum of the design is also shown.
