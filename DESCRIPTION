Description: Constructs nested block designs for unstructured treatment sets
    where blocks can be repeatedly nested and treatments can have different
    levels of replication. Block sizes are equal when possible or differ by at
    most one unit in any one stratum. Blocks strata are optimized in sequence
    from top to bottom with the blocks in each nested stratum optimized within
    the blocks of the next higher stratum. The design output is a data table
    giving a randomised allocation of treatments to blocks with the achieved
    A-efficiency for each stratum and an upper bound where feasible (equal
    replication and equal block sizes)
