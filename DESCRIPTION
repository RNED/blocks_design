Description: Nested block designs for unstructured treatment sets
    where blocks can be repeatedly nested and treatments can have different
    levels of replication. Blocks strata are optimized hierarchically with each set of nested blocks optimized conditionally within 
    the levels of the preceding set of blocks. Block sizes are always equal where possible or differ by at most one unit in any one stratum. 
    The design output is a data table giving a randomised allocation of treatments to blocks together with a plan table showing
    treatments in blocks and a set of blocks-by-treatments incidence matrices, one for each blocks stratum.
